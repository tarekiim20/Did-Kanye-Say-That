Hello! This is a simple game where you have to guess if famous singer Kanye West said that quote or not!


All you have to do to make this work for you is just download the file and install the node packages using:

npm i

then you should run the server (index.js) by using:

nodemon index.js

then open your browser and go to the following link:

localhost:3000

You can fork the repo to improve the game and that would be much of an honor.Just try to comment out the logic behind your development.

Enjoy the game xoxo 


Cheers
